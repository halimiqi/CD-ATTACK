﻿﻿# CD-ATTACKThe Implemention of paper "Adversarial Attack on Community Detection by Hiding Individuals"<sup>[1]</sup>. It is accepted by The Web Conference 2020.![CD-ATTACK](https://github.com/halimiqi/CD-ATTACK/blob/master/cdattack.png)  ## UsageTo train the CD-ATTACK model, please run the *main.py* as `python main.py`To restore a trained model, the command is `python main.py --train False --trained_our_path [THE CHECKPOINT NAME]`The checkpoint name is formated as the string of the time point of starting the training process. eg. `python main.py --train False --trained_our_path 200305112921` .The checkpoints will be recorded automatically for every training process. And the checkpoints files are placed in directory checkpoints/The default dataset is dblp with fixed target users. To change the other dataset or modify other changeable parameters, please run `python main.py -h` to see the details. ## EnviormentThe model is implemented based on python=3.6.7 and tensorflow =1.15. Other requirements of the enviorment is listed in *requirements.txt*.## SettingThe code is training on Nvidia-TitanX GPU with 12 Gb RAM. The CPU is i7-7800X and the memory is 64Gb. This is not the minimum required setting for this project. Other hardware setting may also feasible for this implemention.---[1] Li, Jia, et al.
